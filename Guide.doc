Guide of Godfather:
 
No bot:
For this you first need a locked account. This locked account must have at least $10 purchase. Only then is the no bot support activated. The best thing to do is to lock the account by asking "can I change my email please".
 
Then all the questions come which one answered completely absurdly or completely wrong. So supercell will lock the account because they think it's not the real owner.
 
How does no bot work?
Change from your new th2 (burner) to the locked account and write "hi". Now switch back to th2 and this conversation (convo) from the locked account will be available.
 
>
 
VPN:
Phish accounts only with VPN, otherwise there is a risk of an ip ban.
 
Create the burner on an ip from the country in which the account was created.
(Less instant bans).
 
-Good VPNs-
NordVPN
HMA
Hotspot shield (free).
 
HMA is the best 
 
>
 
Instant link:
You can instantly link accounts that were created on the same ip. For example, if someone has access to your account, you can instantly link them because their ip is available on your account. If Instant Link doesn't work with the bot, you can do it with Agent (risky).
 
For this :
Provide support in French, write “Bonjour”. Now they send you O.T.T.O. Go to supercell id lost, and so until otto tag asks. Now give tag, name, townhall level and clan. If the player is not in a clan, write an "x". If they ask for an email after clan it worked, if they ask for a reason it didn’t work. Ignore them if they ask for a reason, otherwise your account will be banned.
 
>
 
linktrap:
 
To link a person to Trappen (to get their ip) you have to send them a link.
 
(https://grabify.link)
this is the website where you create this link.
 
Enter a URL that you want to show him, e.g. a screenshot of a profile.
 
A link with a verification code will now be created. Hide this link by selecting a different format than "grabify" e.g. screenshot.best
 
As soon as the person clicks on the link, the ip, device, etc. will be displayed.

Last session:
One of the easiest or my favorite questions.
 
There are several methods to find out the last session.
 
1. Kuilin / chocolate collision. Often wrong, but sometimes it can help.
2. Clash of Stats, go to history and then to last upgrades. The last upgrade can often be the last game session.
3. Obstacles can be a very crucial clue.
- Logmas tree -> December 2020.
- Golden cake -> if it spawns more than 3 times it is often October 2020 (if there is no logmas tree).
- 2012,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20 tree can have references to the year of the last meeting. For example, if an obstacle has a 2012 & 2013 tree but not a newer one, the last session is 2013. Just say “my last game session was around 2013”.
- Gravestone 2014 -> Halloween 2014.
- This elixir fountain -> Summer 2020.
- This Skelli statue -> September 2020.
- Moon obstacles -> February 2021.
 
4. Upgrades:
- Queen of level 70 -> Summer 2020.
- Headhunters not yet activated -> Spring-Summer 2020.
- No invisible spell / log launcher yet but level 75 heroes -> November / December 2020.
 
Say the following things to support if that last session is the month (never say the exact month):
 
January = beginning of 20XX
February = early 20XX
March = spring 20XX
April = spring 20XX
May = spring-summer 20XX
June = summer 20XX
July = summer 20XX
August = summer 20XX
September = autumn 20XX
October = autumn-winter 20XX
November = end of 20XX
December = very late 20XX

receipt:
often the question comes up ...
there are two ways of doing this.
 
1. Either you send a fake receipt (only iOS receipts), what’s often doesn’t work.
2. you bypass them, here are some bypasses:
 
Apple variant:
I can confirm that I bought (gold passes / gems / offers, depending on what the account has bought) multiple times but all my receipts were on my old Apple-ID, which was on my old (device from the account), which broke ( the reason why I lost my account). So now to had to create a new Apple ID and lost my old receipts. But yes I had purchases.
 
Android variant:
I can confirm that I bought (gold passes / gems / offers, depending on what the account has bought) multiple times but all my receipts were on my old Google Play Account, which was on my old (device from the account), which broke ( the reason why I lost my account). So now to had to create a new email and lost my old receipts. But yes I had purchases.
 
Paypal bypass:
I have done purchases but I only bought [gems and special offers] with PayPal and because of that, the receipts got sent onto my PayPal account. But after some complications with PayPal, they locked my Paypal account (where the receipts got sent to).
 
obstacles receipt bypass:
 
"I only bought gems, I lost my receipts, when my iPad broke (the reason why I lost it)
 
I hope your still willing to help me! "

𝟼 ᴅɪɢɪᴛs :
 
usually only tags which are created around 2012 august-october get 6 digits.
 
If the account is us/ canada/ china I’d always say summer-autumn 2012.
 
Keep in mind if the account has stones Its always august 2012.
 
If the account has a 2012 tree, 6 digits but isn’t us/ Canada/ china say autumn-winter 2012.
 
#UXXXXX = august 2012
———————————————————
𝟽 ᴅɪɢɪᴛs :
I’m saying for 7 digit tags usually early af 2013 but there are some exceptions :
 
#UXXXXXX = December 2012
#2XXXXXX = December 2012
#LXXXXXX = December 2012 
 
on all other 7 digits just say early 2013.
———————————————————
𝟾 ᴅɪɢɪᴛs
8 digits are on 85% middle 2014 created.
 
#QXXXXXXX = late 2013
#GXXXXXXX = early mid 2013
#RXXXXXXX = summers 2013
#VXXXXXXX = always 2014
#PXXXXXXX = early-middle 2014
#9XXXXXXX = middle 2014
———————————————————
𝟿 ᴅɪɢɪᴛs
Those are pretty easy 
 
#2xxxxxxxx - mid-late 2015
#8xxxxxxxx - early- mid 2015
#9xxxxxxxx - 2016
#pxxxxxxxx - late 16- 2017
#yxxxxxxxx - late 17-2018
#lxxxxxxxx late 18-2019
#qxxxxxxxx late 20-2021

Location:
 
It depends on what kind of account you phish, e.g. with a th13 max you can (mostly) see the location in your previous clans.
 
Exceptions:
Some obstacles / with older accounts no old clans are displayed on cos. There are now 3 options for this:
 
1. Martin in French (around 1:30 p.m.) or Daniela H.R. in English (approx. 12 p.m. - 3 p.m. from Friday to Wednesday).
2.  Bypass location:
Umm hi there again, I know in (year when the account was created) I was traveling through the whole world so I don’t know where I was around (season / creation month). I just can tell you I created it (year / month).
3. You speak in the above-mentioned languages ​​(e.g. French) because location is often not itchy.
 
In any case, flags can also be a clue. If there are several flags, there is often a middle or central flag which often corresponds to the location.
 
A clan name / account name can also be an indication of the location.
The clan description can also be an important clue (if he's in a clan).
For both things go to google translate, then go to "recognize language" and paste in the description / name.
 
This rarely works, but when it works it's fine.
 
>
 
Previous names:
that is very, very difficult at the moment, because chocolate clash (kuilin) ​​was fixed.
However, there is always a possibility to find old names in previous clans (see cos).
You can find old names through a fwl admin through good contacts, but it is very difficult.
If you have enough accounts you could start fwl yourself.
 
For old names of ranked accounts there is a platform called github
 
(https://github.com/doodspav/LegendLeagueSeasons)
 
To do this, go to "go to file" and then simply click on the month in which the account was ranked.
 
OR you just buy unks/ konis name change bot.
 
>
 
devices:
 
this is the hardest question of all, however there are several methods.
 
The best way to find out:
let's say for example we have a max th13 (us location).
 
I would say iPad. If you ask for more devices, iPad is the right choice.
 
Ban = false.
 
if they ask for more devices, say iPhone 6.
 
Ban = false
 
next try:
I've used my iPad and my iPhone to play.
 
more devices / model = correct
Ban = false.
 
Let's say you get a ban. That means iPad is correct but iPhone is wrong.
 
Now I would start saying iPad + Samsung cell phone.
 
Ban = false
 
Let's say the questions about the model then you say s series.
 
Ban = false
 
next try.
iPad + Samsung Galaxy a series you say then.
 
If you ask for a model, you are correct.
 
Now you have to see which Samsung a was used in the year in which the account was created.
 
Locations + devices:
China -> oppo, huawei, og ranked Chinese = ipad
 
Germany -> many are Samsung but many are also iOS so just try it out.
 
India -> Xiaomi (mostly redmi), Samsung j series, Oneplus, Motorola, huawei, Oppo
 
French -> also simply test iOS and Samsung.
 
USA -> mostly iOS, if not Samsung
 
Canada -> mostly iOS, if not Samsung
 
Russia -> Samsung S series, after 2017 many are huawei. Alcatel is also possible.
 
Brazil -> og brazil = Samsung, mostly S series, later huawei, Xiaomi
 
Australia -> iPad + Samsung cell phone mostly
 
Keep in mind: most pushers use a tablet, i.e. iPad / Samsung tab / Amazon tab. Lenovo tab is also possible.
 
If neither Samsung nor iOS, nor huawei nor Xiaomi works, try
 
- Motorola
- Oppo
- Oneplus
- Sony
- Google
- VIVO
- ASUS
- HTC
 
(Try exactly in that order)
 
If that doesn't work either and you really want the account, there is a possibility that it is those brands:
 
Alcatel
Blackberry
Cat
Doogee
Fairphone
Gigaset
LG
Nokia
Razer
ZTE
Wiko
 
Remember, most accounts have been on an iPad / tablet.
 
You can also get devices out via an ip trap.
 
Most people are full iOS or full android and not iOS android mixed.
 
2012:
is mostly iPad, if the model asks always say iPad 3. If ban then iPad 1/2. If banned on iPad then try iPhone 4. Very rarely iPod.
 
2013:
iPhone 5 / Samsung Galaxy s3 / 4 / iPad, Samsung tablet.
 
2014:
iPhone 5/6, iPad, Samsung s3-5, Samsung tab, Samsung a3
 
2015:
iPhone 6, Samsung Galaxy s3-6, Samsung galax j1 / 2, Samsung tablet iPad
 
2016:
iPhone 6/7 iPad, Samsung Galaxy s3-7, Samsung tablet, Xiaomi, Samsung galaxy j1-5
 
2017:
iPhone 6/7/8, j1-3, samsung s5-7, xiaomi, huawei, samsung tablet
 
2018:
iPhone 8 / X / XS / XR, Samsung Galaxy s5-9, Samsung j, Huawei, Xiaomi
 
2019:
Samsung galaxy a2, Samsung galaxy s5-10, iPhone 8 / X / XS / XR, iPad, Samsung galaxy tab, huawei, xiaomi
 
2020:
Samsung s8-20, samsung j, samsung a, huawei, xiaomi, iphone x / xr / xs iphone 11 / pro, ipad, samsung tablet
 
2021:
iPhone 6-12, iPad, Samsung tablet, Xiaomi, huawei, Samsung s7-21, Samsung a, Samsung
 
Xiaomi:
there are several series of them.
If you ask for a model, start with redmi.
Next try Xiaomi Mi
 
Huawei:
Start with Honor, then try mate, then try, p series, then y series.
 
iPad & Samsung Tablet:
If it is confirmed and you ask for a model, then just look when which iPad model was released.
 
With the other random brands you also have to see when what was released. In any case, brands other than iOS / Samsung / huawei / Xiaomi are only present in 5% of all accounts.
 
You can remember devices based on the layout on Instagram. The image quality also plays a very important role.
 
iOS quality is better than android for pictures.
Emojis also give clues about the cell phone brand. This _____ on cell phones as a home button indicates Apple.
 
Screen recordings = iOS
Screen dot = android

Hi again (agent's name)
 
Thanks for the fast reply ❤️❤️
 
Umm those questions are pretty unexpected but I'll try to answer them 🤝
 
1. I've created my account around middle 2014 in the United States of America.
2. I've used my iPad, my iPhone 6 to play. I've might done a few war attacks on my wife’s iPhone 8.
3. My last game session was around summer 2020.
 
Thanks for your help, I'm very proud of you !!
 
Best regards from the United States of America 🇺🇸
